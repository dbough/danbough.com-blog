Imagine refugees who have fled from a hopeless situation.  Fled to give their families a better life.  Fled to a country whose powers-that-be claim that they are Christians.  Imagine luring those people onto plane, telling them that you are bringing them to a place where their working papers will be fast tracked so that they can start their new life.  And then dumping those people.  Men, women, and children. Dumping them in an unsuspecting town, without telling them where exactly they were, and leaving them there to fend for themselves.  Third world stuff, right?  Wrong.

Thats exactly what Ron DeSantis, the ~~Dictator~~ Governor of Florida did yesterday.  [He lured and sent 50 unsuspecting refugees onto a plane in Texas and sent them to Martha's Vineyard, leaving them there to fend for themselves](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/15/1123109768/migrants-sent-to-marthas-vineyard).

> The migrants said a woman they identified as "Perla" approached them outside the shelter and lured them into boarding the plane, saying they would be flown to Boston where they could get expedited work papers. She provided them with food. The migrants said Perla was still trying to recruit more passengers just hours before their flight.

He was more than happy to take credit for it too.

Clearly this was a political stunt.  Using people.  Desperate families, just trying to make a better life for themselves.  For their children.  Why kind of evil creature does this?  Especially one that claims to be a Christian.

I am really hopeful that this stunt backfires.  Elections are coming up.  Its time to vote this creature out.
