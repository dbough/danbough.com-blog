"Scooter boy ... SCOOT SCOOT" I yell as I trot across the living room, pumping my fist like I was asking a truck driver to honk their horn.

I bought myself an electric scooter.  And with it I gave myself the moniker "Scooter Boy" who's apparent catch phrase is "SCOOT SCOOT".  My wife and kids roll their eyes.

I'd been wanting a simple electric scooter for a while.  For no other reason than it looked fun and I just wanted one.  I don't need it.  Its not like I live in an area that is conducive to non-vehicle commuting.  Not even to run up to the store to get a few things.  Or a sandwich shop to get some lunch.  I mean, I work from home for god sake.  I don't _need_ to go anywhere.

I was having a particularly bad few days and gave in to the self-directed peer pressure to just get one.  So I did.  And I'm loving it.  Is it a mid-life crisis badge of (dis)honor?  Sure.  But a mild one at least.

SCOOT SCOOT!
