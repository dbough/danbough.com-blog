Yesterday was the anniversary of one of the most tragic events in US history. It feels like so long ago.  Another lifetime.  At the same time the memories of what happened that day are still vivid.

I was home from work sick on 9/11/2001.  It was around 8:30am.  I sat on the couch, watching TV.  I saw a lot of the events unfold in real time.  I witnessed one of the planes hit one of the towers.  It was surreal.  It was gut wrenching.

The anniversary is a day to reflect on that tragedy, how it has changed our nation forever, and - maybe more importantly - how it brought the people of the United States together.  A huge contrast from how things are now.  A place we should strive to work towards again.  Without the spark caused by a tragedy.

Never forget.
