Process is a crutch.  Or maybe more like guardrails.  And for a part of my professional life, I was anxious without it.

The truth is, even with a process for everything you might encounter *today*, there will be new challenges tomorrow that will be pre-process (or will never have one.)

We want to know what to do in any given situation.  We will spend hours on end planning and documenting the steps to take in every situation so that we don't have to think as much when it comes time to execute.

I'm all for that.  Process helps prevent mistakes and the fallout that happens from them.  Especially when the consequences for not getting things right are high.  Like surgery.  Or sending astronauts to the moon.

The issue with process is that it wont cover all situations all the time.  And if you are a part of anything that evolves -- a growing company for example -- there will always be new things.  Things that don't have a process.  And you will still need to take some action -- even in critical situations -- regardless of whether one exists.

The bottom line is that you can't depend on process.  Don't expect to.
