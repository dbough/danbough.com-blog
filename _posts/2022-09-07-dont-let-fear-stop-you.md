I've spent a lot of my life living in fear.  Fear that others will find out that I'm a fraud.  Fear that I'll look foolish or uncool for being really in to a thing.  It's stopped me from progressing down a path and in the way that I really wanted to.  For a long. Damn. Time.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It‚Äôs felt vulnerable to me to believe I could actually live out some of my bigger dreams and ideas. Perhaps a mix of 1) what it would mean if I failed and/or 2) some holdover conditioning of how ‚Äúuncool‚Äù it is to try hard / care deeply. Getting over that is learned. And not easy.</p>&mdash; Justin Mezzell (ü•É,ü¶â) (@JustinMezzell) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinMezzell/status/1567469083079106562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This tweet came through my feed today.  It resonated.  Like a lot.  It sums up precisely how I've felt.  Even though I had no idea at the time. 

A lot of the things I'm doing and experiencing now are in opposition of that fear.  Screw you for getting in the way of me being who I am much sooner!

I wish I could go back and live more authentically at a younger age.  At the same time I think I needed to live that life to come to this exact realization.  I suspect that mid-life is kind of where realizations like this happen.  I think there is a term for that ...
