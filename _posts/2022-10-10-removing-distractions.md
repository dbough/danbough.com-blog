Twitter.  How useful is the platform, really?  Am I willing to allow it to consume brain cycles that could be used for more meaningful things?

I removed it from my phone today.  Not for the first time.  I constantly find myself doom scrolling, looking or the next dopamine hit.  What did TFG do this time?  Is he in jail yet?  What stupid thing did Elon say?  Has Russia stopped attacking the Ukraine?  Did it drop a nuke somewhere?

While arguably some of this matters, it doesn't matter "right this second".  There is no reason to allow myself to be controlled by the algorithm.  To constantly scroll through trending topics, looking for something juicy that I will really only look at and think about on a surface level before I scroll to the next thing.  

And my normal Twitter feed.  What a useless mess that is.  I barely see posts from the people I actually follow (which, by the way, I recently took the time to pair down to only people I care to hear from.)  Its all advertisements in disguise ("98% of people that use Google don't know about these 10 tricks. -- a thread" ...".

It's time to stop paying attention to things that don't matter.
