We have the ability to make or break a person's day.  What to do?

Bad moods happen to everyone.  When they happen to you, it's important to do whatever you can to prevent that bad mood from spreading.

For me, that generally means isolating myself while I'm in the thick of it.  If no one is around, there isn't an opportunity to affect them with the bad vibes.  

It can also be helpful to talk about it.  Admit that you are "in a mood" even if you can't put your finger on why.  That gives a face to the thing that you are feeling.  Making it tangible, you can address it directly (or ignore it all together.)
