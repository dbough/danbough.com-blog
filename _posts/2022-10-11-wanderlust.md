I wanted to go for a long walk.

I am, for whatever reason, drawn to stories of adventure.  Not necessarily the Jack Sparrow pirating all over the Caribbean type (although I enjoy those stories too), but the everyday-man picking up and leaving the comfort of his cushy life to find himself in a long hike in the woods.

A good part of me has wanderlust.  I have had the feeling for a good chunk (or all?) of my adult life.  The need to see the world.  To think deeply about it.  And to walk away a changed man.

That feeling has always been offset by some pragmatic piece of reality.  It costs money.  What if I get hurt?  I have to work.  Blah blah blah.  You know, normal stuff that most people think about on any given day.

I've been listening to the book "Trespassing Across America" by [Ken Ilgunas](https://www.kenilgunas.com/), living vicariously through his trek across Canada and the US. It has stirred that sense of wanderlust that often lays dormant, suppressed by life's needs.  While I don't have the urge to hike 2000 miles for months on end through the winter months, it has given me the urge to "get out there" and experience some right-sized adventure.
