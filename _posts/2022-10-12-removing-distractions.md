I removed Twitter and LinkedIn from my phone.  Again.

This isn't the first time that I've removed social media apps from my phone to gain back some precious cycles of attention during the day.  It got to be too much.  Checking one or the other every few minutes to see what I missed.

In the past I tried simply turn off notifications for the apps.  That act backfired though.  I was manually checking to see what was happening more often.

I have found deep work to be so incredibly satisfying over the last 10 months.  Social media, at least the way I was consuming it, is directly at odds with deep work.  Stealing your attention away and forcing a recalibration with the thing you were focusing on just before.
